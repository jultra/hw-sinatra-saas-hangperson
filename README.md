Hangperson CI 
=============

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/saasbook/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson-ci.svg?token=CPXPCn5Dy1cwCKsavtqL&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/saasbook/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson-ci)

Please find instructions for the homework itself at: https://github.com/saasbook/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson/blob/master/README.md

This is a private repo which contains the Gradescope solution and autograder, both in ZIP and expanded format.

This [template repo](https://github.com/saasbook/gradescope_rspec_assignment) has more references and examples for grading with Gradescope.

### Current Test running

Testing doesn't currently work

### Legacy Test Running

The following approach is what used to work for an old version of the grader that allowed us to grade assignsments from the command line.  However that functionality was removed following the refactoring to use the XQueue gem ...

To bundle install everything on OSX you might first need:

```
$ brew install libmagic
```

In order to run the tests first run the following to install the latest production version of the grader:

```sh
$ bundle exec cucumber install/
```

Note the above command might take a long time to install since it will be installing all the gems for the grader itself.

Assuming that installs the grader successfully you can then run the cucumber tests of the assignment itself against the production grader like so:

```sh
$ bundle exec cucumber
```

## Walkthrough 


Note that these are opinionated walkthroughs from Sam Joseph.  Opinions expressed are those of Sam Joseph alone and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of UCBerkeley or any to it's employees.

We can follow the initial instructions in "Part 0: Demystifying SaaS app creation" with these commands:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ mkdir hello_sinatra
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ cd hello_sinatra
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ubuntu/workspace/hello_sinatra/.git/
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ touch Gemfile # or `bundle init`
```

and then we put the specified contents in the Gemfile and run bundle:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ gem install bundler
Fetching: bundler-1.15.3.gem (100%)
Successfully installed bundler-1.15.3

Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 6 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
```

We may need to use `gem install bundler` if the bundle gem is not currently on our system.   Then we can add our files to version control as specified:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git add .
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git commit -m 'Set up the Gemfile'
[master (root-commit) eeee73a] Set up the Gemfile
 2 files changed, 29 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Gemfile
 create mode 100644 Gemfile.lock
```

We create the `app.rb` and `config.ru` files as specified, add the contents indicated in the instructions, and add to version control:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ touch app.rb
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ touch config.ru
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git add .
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git commit -m 'adds app.rb and config.ru files'
[master 0dd416c] adds app.rb and config.ru files
 2 files changed, 9 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 app.rb
 create mode 100644 config.ru
```

We can now run the server on cloud 9:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ bundle exec rackup -p $PORT -o $IP
[2017-07-29 09:04:07] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2017-07-29 09:04:07] INFO  ruby 2.3.0 (2015-12-25) [x86_64-linux]
[2017-07-29 09:04:07] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=2222 port=8080
```

and cloud 9 will tell us the URL we can go to to see the running app:

![Cloud9 Help: Your code is running at URL message](images/Screenshot%202017-07-29%2018.02.01.png?dl=1)

It should look like this:

![Hello World message from Sinatra](images/Screenshot%202017-07-29%2018.03.24.png?dl=1)

After you've clicked through on a message about how this is an application preview:

![This is the preview of an application being developed with Cloud9 IDE](images/Screenshot%202017-07-29%2018.04.36.png?dl=1)

As we proceed to follow the instructions we'll see the live log from the server displayed in the terminal shell:

```sh
133.202.198.78 - - [29/Jul/2017:09:04:10 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 74 0.0131

```

We'll have to quite the app with Ctrl-C and restart to see any changes to our app.rb file:

```sh
^C[2017-07-29 09:10:48] INFO  going to shutdown ...
[2017-07-29 09:10:48] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start done.
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ bundle exec rackup -p $PORT -o $IP
[2017-07-29 09:10:52] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

[2017-07-29 09:10:52] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=2253 port=8080
```

Now you should see any changes you made to app.rb, such as "Goodbye World".  The instructions now tell you to add the rerun gem to the Gemfile and re-run the server with a different command.  If you can remember how to shut down the server (Ctrl-c) you might get the following message:

```sh
^C[2017-07-29 09:13:52] INFO  going to shutdown ...
[2017-07-29 09:13:52] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start done.
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ bundle exec rerun -- rackup -p $PORT -o $IP
bundler: command not found: rerun
Install missing gem executables with `bundle install`
```

Note that `bundle` is short for `bundle install` - they are equivalent - use the former if you prefer to type less:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ bundle

```

Now we can use rerun:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ bundle exec rerun -- rackup -p $PORT -o $IP

We should be using a more recent version of ruby, but will need to wait for Cloud9 to update ... :-(

Anyhow, with rerun in operation we can check that changes to app.rb are immediately available.  And our terminal output will look something like this:


```sh

To commit out latest changes to git we can use the following commands:

`git status` just allows us to check what has changed since we last committed.


We can then update the heroku toolbelt as specified:

Assuming you have a heroku account you can then login as follows:

```
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials:
Email: <YOUR EMAIL>
Password: ************
Logged in as <YOUR EMAIL>
```

You can then run heroku create:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ heroku create hangperson2017
Creating ⬢ hangperson2017... done
https://hangperson2017.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/hangperson2017.git
```

Note that if you specify a name for the app, that will become the subdomain of the URL, and might be easier for you to remember what the app was for later. 

Now we need to add the Procfile with the specified contents and commit that to git:

```sh
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ touch Procfile
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Procfile

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git add .
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git commit -m 'adds Procfile'
[master b9800f4] adds Procfile
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 Procfile
```


Then we can deploy to heroku:

```
tansaku:~/workspace/hello_sinatra (master) $ git push heroku master

Note that these are opinionated walkthroughs from Sam Joseph.  Opinions expressed are those of Sam Joseph alone and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of UCBerkeley or any to it's employees.

We start by following the instructions to clone the skeleton code.  Note that we should do this in the root workspace/ directory on c9 to avoid a git clobber.  Specifically we move out of the previous hello-world app dir and onto the c9 root to create a new project with it's own git control.

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace $ git clone https://github.com/saasbook/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson

Receiving objects: 100% (348/348), 158.90 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (182/182), done.
```

Then we move into that directory and try to run `bundle exec auto test` as specified

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace $ cd hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson/
RVM used your Gemfile for selecting Ruby, it is all fine - Heroku does that too,
you can ignore these warnings with 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore /home/ubuntu/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson/Gemfile'.
To ignore the warning for all files run 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore allGemfiles'.

c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec autotest
bundler: command not found: autotest
Install missing gem executables with `bundle install`
```

which gives us an error reminding us to run `bundle install` or the equivalent `bundle`.  This may take some time to complete:

Now I (Sam) am not the biggest fan of auto test, since I find it unreliable, and I also worry that pedagogically we are hitting the students with reams and reams of output here, and I would much rather get the students into the habit of running the individual tests with commands like:

```sh
bundle exec rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:13
```

and getting them into the habit of running the main `rspec` on ever increasing sets of tests so that they are taking more executive control of the testing process, but each to their own. 

So now the students are expected to try out the two self-check tests in order to understand how to proceed and make the failing test pass.

We can follow the suggestion to add `attr_accessors` to the `lib/hangperson` class as follows:

  
```rb
  attr_accessor :word
  attr_accessor :guesses
  attr_accessor :wrong_guesses
```

although it's not the only way, and we might feel that using `attr_accessor` is a bit of a code smell as discussed in the following links:


https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/rv4yo/get_rid_of_that_code_smell_attributes/
https://github.com/troessner/reek/blob/master/docs/Attribute.md

Please also see the "principle of least privilege": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege

Note also that the self-check question about instance variables it not actually correct in that the tests are not specifying the hangperson class has instance variables, they are specifying that they have certain instance methods available, so in fact adding `attr_accessor` methods here is breaking the rule of only ever do the absolute minimum to make tests pass.  Perhaps I'm being overly pedantic here, but there is no need to make instance variables to make these tests pass.  The tests will move on in exactly the same way with the following code:

```rb
  def word
    @word
  end
  def guesses
  end
  def wrong_guesses
  end
```

or

```rb
  attr_reader :word
  attr_reader :guesses
  attr_reader :wrong_guesses
```

I guess it all depends what we want the students to be focusing on here.  Is is the nice ruby shorthand with `attr_accessor` (or `attr_reader`) or is it how to ensure to respond to test failures with minimum changes and to understand the side-effects of what they are doing and how they are affecting the encapsulation of the class under study here.

Here we also see that the operation of `autotest` with all the pending tests makes it onerous to compare one test error to the next, which would be must easier if we were running `bundle exec rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:13`.


However you make the change, the tests won't pass immediately - you'll get this new error:

```

```

This is because by default the "getter" specified by attr_reader or attr_accessor will return a nil rather than the expected empty string.  If we've used attr_'s we'll need to set the default response in the constructor.  If we've created explicit methods we can set a default value there and avoid instance variables.  Of course since we're being told to create instance variables it makes sense to follow that advice.

If we adjust the constructor like so:

```rb
  def initialize(word)
    @word = word
    @guesses = ''
    @wrong_guesses = ''
  end
```

we should see the test pass, although it is heavily obscured by all the pending tests:

So if we continue to follow the instructions we remove pending from more locations.  Immediate confusion may arise as in the next test block we have to remove pending from two locations: lines 22 and 28.  [Note: presumably we could remove the pending from line 22 in the skeleton to avoid this possibility for confusion]

There are also tips about debugging, however this is another place where I would recommend running individual tests.  If you have debug breakpoints and autotest running together then you may end up getting confused about which test run you are on when you catch on the breakpoint.  If you are running a specific test via `rspec spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:17` then you are always clear.

Anyhow, the next error we encounter if we have removed pending from lines 22 and 28 is as follows:

```
  1) HangpersonGame guessing correctly changes correct guess list
     Failure/Error: @valid = @game.guess('a')
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `guess' for #<HangpersonGame:0x00000002bab3d0>
       Did you mean?  guesses
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:26:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

and we can change that error by adding the following code (note, we are only adding the code required to change the message, we are specifically not getting involved in trying to work out exactly what this method should do):

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    
  end
```

in which case we get the following errors:

```
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing correctly changes correct guess list
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.guesses).to eq('a')
       
       expected: "a"
            got: ""
       
       (compared using ==)
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:29:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'

  2) HangpersonGame guessing correctly returns true FIXED
     Expected pending 'No reason given' to fail. No Error was raised.
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:32

  3) HangpersonGame guessing incorrectly returns true FIXED
     Expected pending 'No reason given' to fail. No Error was raised.
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:45

```

The following code will fix this error:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    @guesses << letter
  end
```

At this point we are left with these two failures from what should be failing tests:

```
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing correctly returns true FIXED
     Expected pending 'No reason given' to fail. No Error was raised.
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:32

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:45 # HangpersonGame guessing incorrectly returns true
```

which is confusing ... but this is because RSpec is expecting these pending tests to fail:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25041974/rspec-pending-results-in-falied-test

As of RSpec 3.x pending tests are run and if they pass then a failure is raised.  Perhaps these would be better specified as 'skipped' or the methods should explicitly raise errors.

Given the current skeleton we can just remove pending from these failing tests and these tests will pass and the failure warnings will go away. Note that these failures appeared at this point because we implemented the `guess` instance method and in the process made more than one test pass.  Some of those tests were pending and thus we got a warning.  In the normal TDD flow those tests wouldn't have been written yet, so it wouldn't have been such an issue.

Now let's delete the pending command on line 41 which gives us this output:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing incorrectly changes wrong guess list
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.guesses).to eq('')
       
       expected: ""
            got: "z"
       
       (compared using ==)
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:42:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.03392 seconds (files took 1.64 seconds to load)
18 examples, 1 failure, 13 pending

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:41 # HangpersonGame guessing incorrectly changes wrong guess list

```

We can pass this test with this code:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    if word.chars.include? letter
      @guesses << letter
    else
      @wrong_guesses << letter
    end
  end
```

Now let's delete the pending command from line 54 and we get this failure:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly does not change correct guess list
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.guesses).to eq('a')
       
       expected: "a"
            got: "aa"
       
       (compared using ==)

18 examples, 1 failure, 12 pending

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:54 # HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly does not change correct guess list
```

indicating that we want elements in guesses to be unique.  Here I'm tempted to use the Ruby set class, but since we're using attr_reader that would be a little more involved. Instead I can update the code like so:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    if word.chars.include? letter
      @guesses << letter unless guesses.chars.include? letter
    else
      @wrong_guesses << letter
    end
  end
```

deleting line 58 pending command gives us a related error:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly does not change wrong guess list
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.wrong_guesses).to eq('q')
       
       expected: "q"
            got: "qq"
       
       (compared using ==)

Finished in 0.04451 seconds (files took 0.73739 seconds to load)
18 examples, 1 failure, 11 pending

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:58 # HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly does not change wrong guess list
```

which we can fix in a similar fashion:


```rb
  def guess(letter)
    if word.chars.include? letter
      @guesses << letter unless guesses.chars.include? letter
    else
      @wrong_guesses << letter unless wrong_guesses.chars.include? letter
    end
  end
```

We could refactor here since this is rather unDRY, but I'm reluctant to do so until I have a fuller picture of everything's that needed, so I delete the pending statement on line 62 and get this error:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly returns false
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.guess('a')).to be false
       
       expected false
            got nil
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:63:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.04373 seconds (files took 1.03 seconds to load)
18 examples, 1 failure, 10 pending

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:62 # HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly returns false

```

I try this code:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    if word.chars.include? letter
      if guesses.chars.include? letter
        return false
      else
        @guesses << letter
        return true
      end
    else
      @wrong_guesses << letter unless wrong_guesses.chars.include? letter
    end
    false
  end
```

and get this failure:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing incorrectly returns true
     Failure/Error: expect(@valid).not_to be false
       
       expected not #<FalseClass:0> => false

18 examples, 1 failure, 10 pending

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:45 # HangpersonGame guessing incorrectly returns true

```

which leaves me confused until I review the failing test:

```rb
      before :each do
        @game = HangpersonGame.new('garply')
        @valid = @game.guess('z')
      end
      it 'changes wrong guess list' do
        expect(@game.guesses).to eq('')
        expect(@game.wrong_guesses).to eq('z')
      end
      it 'returns true' do
        expect(@valid).not_to be false
      end
```

and I remember that we have this concept of a "valid" guess, which is a letter than you haven't guessed before.  I recall that that is described in the docs:

> A letter that has already been guessed or is a non-alphabet character is considered "invalid", i.e. it is not a "valid" guess

and recall also that it would be nice if that concept was articulated in test descriptions themselves, and I update my code to the increasingly ugly:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    if word.chars.include? letter
      if guesses.chars.include? letter
        return false
      else
        @guesses << letter
        return true
      end
    else
      if wrong_guesses.chars.include? letter
        return false
      else
        @wrong_guesses << letter 
        return true
      end
    end
  end
```

and all the tests pass, thinking this will have to change soon as non-alphabetic characters are also invalid, but I will proceed to the next test that I will remove pending from, on line 66 which is expecting case insensitivity and generates this failure:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly is case insensitive
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.guess('A')).to be false
       
       expected false
            got true
     # ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:67:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.03105 seconds (files took 0.76792 seconds to load)
18 examples, 1 failure, 9 pending

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb:66 # HangpersonGame guessing same letter repeatedly is case insensitive
```

which I can fix with:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    letter = letter.downcase
    if word.chars.include? letter
      if guesses.chars.include? letter
        return false
      else
        @guesses << letter
        return true
      end
    else
      if wrong_guesses.chars.include? letter
        return false
      else
        @wrong_guesses << letter 
        return true
      end
    end
  end
```

and I break my own rule about not modifying incoming arguments but I'll refactor later as I want to get all the pending tests passing first.

I delete pending on line 77 and get:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing invalid throws an error when empty
     Failure/Error: expect { @game.guess('') }.to raise_error(ArgumentError)
       expected ArgumentError but nothing was raised

```

That gets fixed like so:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    raise ArgumentError if letter.empty?
    letter = letter.downcase
```

Deleting line 80 pending gives us:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame guessing invalid throws an error when not a letter
     Failure/Error: expect { @game.guess('%') }.to raise_error(ArgumentError)
       expected ArgumentError but nothing was raised

which we can pass with:

```rb

    letter = letter.downcase
```

deleting pending on line 83 gives us:

```sh

and we can fix that with:

    letter = letter.downcase
```

Another reason for disliking auto test in c9 is that when you scroll back to look at earlier errors you don't automatically get jumped to the latest output which can be confusing for some users.

But let's move on to delete pending from line 89, which gives us these errors:

```sh
Failures:

  1) HangpersonGame displayed word with guesses should be 'b-n-n-' when guesses are 'bn'
     Failure/Error: expect(@game.word_with_guesses).to eq(displayed)

  2) HangpersonGame displayed word with guesses should be '------' when guesses are 'def'

rspec ./spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb[1:3:3] # HangpersonGame displayed word with guesses should be 'banana' when guesses are 'ban'


```

we can make at least one of them pass with:

```rb
  def word_with_guesses
    "------"
  end
```

and all of them pass with:

```rb
  def word_with_guesses
    @word.chars.map { |letter| @guesses.chars.include?(letter) ? letter : '-' }.join
  end
```

let's go on deleting the line 111 pending, to give us:

```sh
Failures:

     Failure/Error: expect(@game.check_win_or_lose).to eq(:win)

18 examples, 1 failure, 2 pending

Failed examples:

```

we can pass that with the following:

```rb
  def check_win_or_lose
    :win
  end
```

notice I'm starting to jump steps here - we can implement just the method with default nil return and see the expectation for :win, but you get the idea.  Doing the above we see we get more warnings about pending tests running:

```

maybe we should have pending on the whole content here not individual elements?

Let's delete the pending on line 115 so we get:

```sh
Failures:

We can pass that with:

```rb

    return :lose if @wrong_guesses.length >= 7
    :win
  end
```

Then we can delete the pending on line 119 and get a final failure:

```sh

which we can then pass with:

  def check_win_or_lose
    return :lose if @wrong_guesses.length >= 7
    return :win if @word.chars - @guesses.chars == []
    :play
  end
```

and all the tests pass, but we are left with a need to refactor!!!!!

We could refactor the guess method like so:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    raise ArgumentError if letter.nil? or letter.empty? or !(letter =~ /[[:alpha:]]/)
    letter = letter.downcase
    guess_type_string = word.chars.include?(letter) ? @guesses : @wrong_guesses
    if guess_type_string.chars.include?(letter) 
      return false
    else
      guess_type_string << letter
      return true
    end
  end
```

which is a bit DRYer, and then we could go even further like so:


```rb
  def guess(letter)
    raise ArgumentError if letter.nil? or letter.empty? or !(letter =~ /[[:alpha:]]/)
    letter = letter.downcase
    guess_type_string = word.chars.include?(letter) ? @guesses : @wrong_guesses
    guess_type_string.chars.include?(letter) ? false : guess_type_string << letter
  end

```

and in both cases all the tests pass.  Of course these ternary statements make it all a little difficult to read, so we might be tempted to do the following:

```rb
  def guess(letter)
    raise ArgumentError if unacceptable_guess?(letter)
    letter.downcase!
    storage = where_to_save_guess(letter)
    valid = is_valid_guess?(letter, storage)
    storage << letter if valid
    valid
  end
  
  private
  
  def unacceptable_guess?(letter)
    letter.nil? or letter.empty? or !(letter =~ /[[:alpha:]]/)
  end
  
  def where_to_save_guess(letter)
    word.chars.include?(letter) ? @guesses : @wrong_guesses
  end
  
  def is_valid_guess?(letter, storage)
    !storage.chars.include?(letter)
  end
```

which also passes all the tests, and is arguably a bit more readable, and explains the intent
a bit better.  Of course we've got the general smell here that the code we've been driven to create violates the principle of command-query separation (CQS) whereby the process of making a guess, is also returning an indication of whether the guess is valid.  Ideally we should be able to ask questions about whether a guess is valid repeatedly without having side effects ...

maybe we could add a self-check question about the way in which CQS is violated here, and set a bonus task of how to adjust the code to overcome it?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation

an alternative refactoring might use sets to store the guesses and wrong guesses ... 







So this section is entirely theory about the design of the app and self-check questions ... ideally students will work through it to improve their understanding of what happens next ...So we've got another chunk of background theory to read, but then we can run the app we've cloned like so:

```
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ cd hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec rerun -- rackup -p $PORT -o $IP

Following the instructions (and self-check question) we should see something like:

![](images/Screenshot%202017-08-07%2018.33.40.png)

and we might be tempted to click on "new game" which will lead to this error message:

![](images/Screenshot%202017-08-07%2018.34.01.png)

Now we can deploy to heroku as instructed.

and note how the error on heroku is displayed a little differently:

![](images/Screenshot%202017-08-07%2018.42.47.png)

because the app is in production mode by default on heroku, rather than development mode on c9


So more self-check questions and then we need to see the cucumber test fail:

```
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ cucumber features/start_new_game.feature

then make the necessary change to the form:

```erb
<form action='/create' method="post">
  <input type="submit" value="New Game"/>

```

and then see the test pass

which should allow us to get to this view on heroku:

![](images/Screenshot%202017-08-08%2014.27.21.png)

Now let's update the `guess` code in the Sinatra `app.rb`.  Note that if we run the feature at this point, we'll see a single failure:

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ cucumber features/guess.feature 
Feature: guess correct letter

If we update the `guess` method as follows:

```
  post '/guess' do
    letter = params[:guess].to_s[0]
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    
    @game.guess(letter)
    
    redirect '/show'
  end

```

we should see the final test pass:

```sh

Note that launchy doesn't work on c9:

https://community.c9.io/t/getting-launchy-gem-to-work-on-cloud9/9896

unless one installs IceWeasel:

```
sudo apt-get install iceweasel
```


So let's follow the instructions to get things all passing:

1.  Pick a new scenario to work on (you should have 2/4 working at this point)
2.  Run the scenario and watch it fail
3.  Develop code that makes each step of the scenario pass
4.  Repeat till all steps passing.

At this point the following should be failing:

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec cucumber -f progress


REMOVED ERROR DETAILS

cucumber features/game_over.feature:7 # Scenario: game over because I guess the word

cucumber features/repeated_guess.feature:15 # Scenario: guess incorrect letter that I have already tried

Let's take the first:

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec cucumber features/game_over.feature:7

```

So this is a problem with not displaying the winning condition.  If we look at app.rb we see:

```rb
  get '/win' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    erb :win # You may change/remove this line
  end
```

the view is already set up for us:

```erb
<h1>You Win!</h1>

<p>
  The word was
  <span class="win"><%= @game.word %></span>.
</p>

<%= erb :new %>

```

Looking at our current guess method in app.rb:

```rb
  post '/guess' do
    letter = params[:guess].to_s[0]
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    
    @game.guess(letter)
    
    redirect '/show'
  end
```

it looks like we are always redirecting to the show method, which has some interesting notes:

```rb
  # Everytime a guess is made, we should eventually end up at this route.
  # Use existing methods in HangpersonGame to check if player has
  # won, lost, or neither, and take the appropriate action.
  # Notice that the show.erb template expects to use the instance variables
  # wrong_guesses and word_with_guesses from @game.
  get '/show' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    erb :show # You may change/remove this line
  end
```

Here we might get distracted by adding things we think we need, or the comments hint we need, but let's stay focused on what the test is asking for, which is that we show the win output in appropriate situations.

We have a `check_win_or_lose` method in our hang person game:

```rb
  def check_win_or_lose
    return :lose if @wrong_guesses.length >= 7
    return :win if @word.chars - @guesses.chars == []
    :play
  end
```

let's use that to choose our template ... 

```rb
  get '/show' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    state = @game.check_win_or_lose
    state = :show if state == :play
    erb state # You may change/remove this line
  end
```

I could have done less here, as this has probably made some other tests pass, but it's too tempting when the `check_win_or_lose` returns two symbols which match the erb template names.  Checking we should see our test pass:

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec cucumber features/game_over.feature:7
Feature: game over
  
  As a player playing Hangperson
  So I can get back to my life 
  I want to know when the game is over

  Scenario: game over because I guess the word   # features/game_over.feature:7
    Given I start a new game with word "foobar"  # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:12
    When I make the following guesses: f,o,b,a,r # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:25
    Then I should see "You Win!"                 # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:72

1 scenario (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)
0m0.089s
Coverage report generated for Cucumber Features to /home/ubuntu/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson/coverage. 60 / 63 LOC (95.24%) covered.
```

Let's check for side-effects:

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec cucumber -f progress
........................F....F........

REMOVED ERROR DETAILS

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/repeated_guess.feature:7 # Scenario: guess correct letter that I have already tried
cucumber features/repeated_guess.feature:15 # Scenario: guess incorrect letter that I have already tried


10 scenarios (2 failed, 8 passed)
38 steps (2 failed, 36 passed)
0m0.492s
Coverage report generated for Cucumber Features to /home/ubuntu/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson/coverage. 61 / 63 LOC (96.83%) covered.
```

So it looks like all our game over tests are passing, and we haven't broken any existing tests.  Let's go on and deal with these repeated guess failures.

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec cucumber features/repeated_guess.feature:7
Feature: guess repeated letter
  
  As a player playing Hangperson
  So that I can avoid wasting guesses on letters I've already tried
  I want to be informed when I guess a letter I've already tried

  Scenario: guess correct letter that I have already tried # features/repeated_guess.feature:7
    Given I start a new game with word "bumblebee"         # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:12
    When I guess "b"                                       # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:19
    And I guess "b" again                                  # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:19
    Then the word should read "b--b--b--"                  # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:34
    And I should see "You have already used that letter"   # features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:72
      expected to find text "You have already used that letter" in "Play Hangperson! Guess a letter Wrong Guesses: Word so far: b--b--b-- Random word generator provided by Watchout4snakes.com -- thanks!" (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:75:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
      ./features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:7:in `with_scope'
      ./features/step_definitions/game_steps.rb:73:in `/^(?:|I )should see "([^\"]*)"(?: within "([^\"]*)")?$/'
      features/repeated_guess.feature:13:in `And I should see "You have already used that letter"'

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/repeated_guess.feature:7 # Scenario: guess correct letter that I have already tried

1 scenario (1 failed)
5 steps (1 failed, 4 passed)
0m0.091s

```


so we need to display "You have already used that letter" at the appropriate time.  There are comments around app.rb's `guess` method that hint at a solution:


```rb
  # Use existing methods in HangpersonGame to process a guess.
  # If a guess is repeated, set flash[:message] to "You have already used that letter."
  # If a guess is invalid, set flash[:message] to "Invalid guess."
  post '/guess' do
    letter = params[:guess].to_s[0]
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    
    @game.guess(letter)
    
    redirect '/show'
  end
```

so we can fix that with:

```rb
  post '/guess' do
    letter = params[:guess].to_s[0]
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    
    valid = @game.guess(letter)
    flash[:message] = "You have already used that letter." unless valid
    
    redirect '/show'
  end
```

and has the side effect of making all the tests pass:

```sh
c9testaduror:~/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson (master) $ bundle exec cucumber -f progress
......................................

10 scenarios (10 passed)
38 steps (38 passed)
0m0.493s
Coverage report generated for Cucumber Features to /home/ubuntu/workspace/hw-sinatra-saas-hangperson/coverage. 62 / 64 LOC (96.88%) covered.
```

which is slightly confusing because we haven't done everything suggested, and there seems to be some confusion about whether a repeated letter is different from invalid.  Since here we are setting, you've already used that letter as being based on the "validity" returned by the `guess` method.


Anyhow, we can push this code to heroku:

because we've got extra tests in the grader that checks that are not in our local test suite ...

we can fix the cheating issues by removing the following direct endpoints from app.rb:

```rb
  get '/win' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    erb :win # You may change/remove this line
  end
  
  get '/lose' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    erb :lose # You may change/remove this line
  end
```

and the "invalid" guesses, but catching the appropriate error:

```rb
  post '/guess' do
    letter = params[:guess].to_s[0]
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    begin  
      valid = @game.guess(letter)
      flash[:message] = "You have already used that letter." unless valid
    rescue ArgumentError
      flash[:message] = "Invalid guess."
    end
    redirect '/show'
  end
```

since it looks like removing the endpoints for cheating breaks the grader and we still need to handle these routes ... the implication from the grader is that we must redirect ... which implies we need something like this:

```rb
  get '/show' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    state = @game.check_win_or_lose
    redirect '/win' if state == :win
    redirect '/lose' if state == :lose
    erb :show # You may change/remove this line
  end
  
  get '/win' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
    redirect '/show' unless @game.check_win_or_lose == :win
    erb :win # You may change/remove this line
  end
  
  get '/lose' do
    ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
     redirect '/show' unless @game.check_win_or_lose == :lose
    erb :lose # You may change/remove this line
  end
```

and if we push this to heroku ... we get 100% from the autograder:
